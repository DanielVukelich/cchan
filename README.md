# C-CHAN
The fastest meme sharing ever.
## HOW TO
### COMPILE
1. Make sure you are running a free GNU/Linux distribution, or at the very least a FSF-approved distribution. If you still run botnet in $CURRENT_YEAR, just go to <https://gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html> and pick your freedom.
2. C-chan currently only requires an C89 compatible standard library (any version of gclib will do), a proper C89 compatible compiler (I suggest the GNU C Compiler, also known as the GNU Compiler Collection), and the package make
3. Run "make"
### INSTALL
No installation atm, just play with the files the way it works tbqh lad
### RUN
Once compiled, run "./cchan"
