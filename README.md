# C-CHAN
The fastest meme sharing service ever.

## HOW TO
### COMPILE
1. Make sure you are running an FSF-approved, POSIX-compliant GNU/Linux distribution, or at the very least a libre \*BSD (still must be POSIX-compliant). If you still run botnet in $CURRENT_YEAR, just go to <https://gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html> and pick your freedom.
2. C-chan currently only requires an C89 compatible standard library (any version of glibc will do), a proper C89 compatible compiler (I suggest the GNU C Compiler, also known as the GNU Compiler Collection), the package make, and OpenSSL-dev (or your distro's equivalent package).
3. Run "make"

### INSTALL
No installation atm, just play with the files the way it works tbqh lad

### RUN
Once compiled, run "./cchan".
NOTE: this does nothing but accept a connection and return a "Index" html file or SIGSEGV.
